* GEP002 - Fix particle geometry navigation (still error with float uncertainty)
* GEP003 - Add energy cut based on range value
* GEP004 - In ct_detector trak_to_in, pixel id calculation and particle counting should move to the digitizer part
* GEP005 - In Bremsstrahlung, xsection can be pre-calculated improving the RandomAtomSelection
* GEP006 - In Bremsstrahlung, track secondary photons
