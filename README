GGEMS Enhancement Proposals (GEP)

* **GEP001 - Fix image reader (according the global frame)**
* *GEP002 - Fix particle geometry navigation (still error with float uncertainty) - JB*
* *GEP003 - Add energy cut based on range value - JB*
* *GEP004 - In ct_detector trak_to_in, pixel id calculation and particle counting should move to the digitizer part - JB*
* **GEP005 - In Bremsstrahlung, xsection can be pre-calculated improving the RandomAtomSelection**
* **GEP006 - In Bremsstrahlung, track secondary photons**
* *GEP007 - In ConeBeamCTSource, spectrum data from file is allocated using f64 buffer, need to change for f32 - JB*
* **GEP008 - Improve PRNG by using others or cuRand, XORWOW is closer to MT from G4**
* **GEP009 - tlimitminfix in eMscScattering and gLatCorrection should be used the defined geometry tolerance**
* **GEP010 - Improve edep deposition while volume and doxel size are different to the phantom. Some aliasing appears in this case.**

GGEMS Bug Reporting (GBR) 

* *GBR001 - No set_model in class of ConeBeamCTSource - JB*
* *GBR002 - No printInfoDetection in class of ConeBeamCTSource - JB*
* *GBR003 - Dose to patient not working while using a voxel size different to the doxel size - JB*
* **GBR004 - Open 01/03/16 JB - Dose to phantom in 03_exePhotonBeam has small artefact between boundary material. Indexes of density voxel are not calculated properly.**
* **GBR005 - Open 03/03/16 JB - With lare range cut edep are not deposed properly between two different boundary material. Management of step length with boundary distance seem not working properly while material change in the next voxel. This issue seem related to GBR004. First investigation leed to a problem of safety calculation in eMscScattering and gLatCorrection. This have to be investigated. Bug can be observed using 03_exePhotonBeam_Phantom with range cut of 100um**
* *GBR006 - Open 06/03/16 JB - Fix typo exit_simulation (Aborted) - close 08/03/16 - JB*
* *GBR007 - Open 07/03/16 JB - Fix dose (no output) and uncertainty calculation (some nan) - close 08/03/16 - JB*
