TODO:
2. Optimized exe by using a code generator that selects only physics effects used on the simulation

Bugs:
1. RegOctree for mesh: when an octree cell is tangential to a triangle and the ray coming through is perpendicular, this ray pass through just between the two cells and the corresponding triangles. To resolve that, while the reg octree is build, every cell should slighy swell by Epsilon to consider triangle of the neighbor cell.
2. Running exeGeometry04 (voxelized source + phantom + PET detector) generates a seg fault when more than 10^6 particles are used. There are still an issue on the navigation while a particle pop-up inside a vox volume...
