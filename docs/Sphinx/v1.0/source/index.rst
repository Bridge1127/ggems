Welcome to GGEMS Documentation
==============================
GGEMS is an advanced Monte Carlo simulation platform using CPU and GPU architecture targeting medical applications (imaging and particle therapy). This code is based on the well-validated Geant4 physics model and capable to be executed in both CPU and GPU devices using the OpenCL library.

The documentation is divided into three parts.

First, as preamble, a introduction of GGEMS is done, and the necessary informations are given in order to install your environment for GGEMS.

Second, for a standard user, informations about all GGEMS potential are given. Benchmarks, examples and tools are also illustrated and explained. And all the command lines are listed using both C++ and Python code.

And finally, in the last part of this documentation, a more detailed description concerning GGEMS core for advanced user is written. The purpose of this part is to give enough informations to an user to implement a custom part of code in GGEMS.
