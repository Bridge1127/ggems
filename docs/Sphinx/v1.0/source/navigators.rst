Navigators
**********

The particles are only tracked in navigator volumes. There are two types of navigators
in GGEMS:

  * System (detector, ...)
  * Phantom (object, patient, ...)

For each navigator, three elements are associated:

 * Solid: geometry of the navigator
 * Material
 * Cross-section: physics of the navigator
