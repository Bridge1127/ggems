Navigators
**********

The particles are only tracked in navigator volumes. There are two types of navigators
in GGEMS:

  * System (detector)
  * Phantom (object, patient)

For each navigator, three elements are associated:

 * a solid: geometry of the navigator
 * a list of materials
 * physical processes
